This is basically any coding  method/function that allows you to iterate over a datastructure(array, graphs etc) easily. 

These methods are things like `forEach`, `for...in`, `map` 

Its pretty common to find these methods built-in in most programming languages but imagine creating a method like `dfs` that does a depth-first-search on a binary tree.([example of dfs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introduction-to-algorithms-with-javascript-examples/#traversing-algorithms))
