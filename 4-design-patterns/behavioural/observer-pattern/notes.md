### Notes

- Observer pattern lets you define a subscription mechanism on an object
- Basically like telling a function to run when some sort of event occurs
- This pattern is basically used by most PubSub systems like SocketIO, SQS, RabbitMQ etc. 
- Had one convo once where we talked about using this as a way of creating domain isolation when implementing DDD.
