In this pattern we try to abstract low level code in our in system in to some sort of easy to use function or class.

For example, imagine we are doing a web scraping of a particular page.

We would want to seperate the large parts of the web scraping into a smaller a function that is easy to use.

See [this repo](https://github.com/chidioguejiofor/scrap-the-web) for this exact example
