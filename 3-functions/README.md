#### Notes about functions

- [ ] A function should be small: Really long functions are intimidating to look at. 
- [ ] A function should do one thing
- [ ] One level of abstraction per function
- [ ] Avoid nested ifs 
- [ ] Your function should do what it says with no side effects.
- [ ] Don't repeat yourself
- [ ] It is okay to write really long messay functions at first but make sure to refactor.
